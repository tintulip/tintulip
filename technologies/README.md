## Root credentials for LZ generated accounts

Accounts generated by the Landing Zone (Audit and Log Archive) are tied to two email addresses chosen at setup time.
As per [documentation (section "Sign in with the root user")](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/best-practices.html), the owner of these email accounts will have the ability of password-reset the `root` identity for these two accounts.

Knowing this, when planning a Control Tower setup it would be important to know who will be in possession of these accounts and plan security controls accordingly.
