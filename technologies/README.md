## Root credentials for LZ generated accounts

Accounts generated by the Landing Zone (Audit and Log Archive) are tied to two email addresses chosen at setup time.
As per [documentation (section "Sign in with the root user")](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/best-practices.html), the owner of these email accounts will have the ability of password-reset the `root` identity for these two accounts.

Knowing this, when planning a Control Tower setup it would be important to know who will be in possession of these accounts and plan security controls accordingly.

## Setting up landing zone
In order for a landing zone to be configured, control tower runs pre-launch checks on your account. To set up a landing zone, we followed the [getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-control-tower.html) instructions. Control tower created two organisational units(ou), `security` and `sandbox` and within `security ou` created two accounts:`log archive` and `audit account`. To create the accounts, control tower required two distinct, unique email addresses that were not associted with an AWS account. 


## Guardrails

Control tower implements preventative or detective controls through guardrails and is applied throughtout the entire organisational unit. When control tower is set up guardrails is automatically enabled and certain controls are mandatory or elective.

## GuardDuty
When control tower is initally enabled, it does not activate guard duty.

## Current Organisation Units Structure
Below is a diagram that represents the organisation units(ou) Control tower has set up as well as an additional ou we have made, workloads OU. It also includes what each `ou` can do which is represented by the pink stickies and the following accounts.
